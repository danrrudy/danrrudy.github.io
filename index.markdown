Welcome! I'm Dan Rudy and this is a personal website about my work and current projects. I'm a second-semester Master's in Public Administration student in The University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public and International Affairs (GSPIA). My professional interests are in state and local government, with an academic focus in strategic capital management, but all those details are listed [in my CV](\cv). I try to be a generalist, and I'm always looking for new topics to dive into. My contact info is listed at the bottom of each page, feel free to reach out if anything catches your interest!
