Welcome! I'm Dan Rudy and this is a personal website for my work, research, and other projects. I'm a second-year Ph.D. Student in Public Administration and Policy at the University of Georgia. I hold an MPA from the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public and International Affaits, as well as undergraduate degrees in Math and Eocnomics from Pitt. [My research interests](\research) center around government finance, administrative capacity, and public decision-making. I'm also interested in election administration and technology in government. 
My professional work covers local government, leadership development, and nonprofit finance, but all those details are listed [in my CV](\cv). I try to be a generalist outside my primary interest, and I'm always looking for new topics to dive into. My contact info is listed at the bottom of each page, feel free to reach out if anything catches your interest!
